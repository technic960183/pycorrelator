Welcome to pycorrelator's documentation!
========================================

**pycorrelator** is a Python package designed to perform cross correlation and self correlation analyses in spherical coordinates.
This is particularly useful in fields such as astrophysics, geophysics, and any domain where objects are naturally distributed on a spherical surface.
Currently, this package only support astrophysics coordinates (Ra, Dec) in degrees. More units and naming convention will be supported in the future.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


Quickstart
----------

- If you want to perform cross-matching between two catalogs, use xmatch function. See [placeholder] for more details.
