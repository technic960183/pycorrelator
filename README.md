## Introduction
`pycorrelator` is a Python package designed to perform cross correlation and self correlation analyses in spherical coordinates. This is particularly useful in fields such as astrophysics, geophysics, and any domain where data points are naturally distributed on a spherical surface.
Currently, this package only support astrophysics coordinates `(Ra, Dec)` in degrees. More units and naming convention will be supported in the future.

## Features
- Efficient computation ( $O(N\log N)$ ) of cross correlation in spherical coordinates.
- Friends-of-Friends (FoF) analysis in spherical coordinates.
- Easy integration with existing data processing packages, such as `pandas`.

## Installation
You can install `pycorrelator` by cloning the codes:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/technic960183/pycorrelator.git
```

pip install will be supported in the future.

## Usage
[TODO] Add the usage of `xmatch` and `group_by_quadtree`.

## Examples
[TODO] Add some examples here.
